# Data-Bridge

**Data-Bridge** is a migration engine designed to simplify the process of moving data from NoSQL databases to SQL-based systems. It focuses on providing a clean, structured architecture for handling data transformation, schema mapping, and migration workflows.

The goal of this project is to reduce the complexity involved in transitioning between database paradigms while keeping the system modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

##  What It Does

* Migrates data from NoSQL sources to SQL databases
* Handles data transformation and structure mapping
* Provides an extensible architecture for evolving migration needs
* Encourages consistency and maintainability across services

##  Architecture Philosophy

Data-Bridge is built around a modular design so that each stage of the migration process can operate independently. This makes the system easier to extend, test, and adapt for different migration scenarios.

Rather than being tightly coupled to a single database or workflow, the engine is intended to be flexible enough to support future enhancements as requirements grow.

##  Project Status

Currently under active development. Features and architecture may evolve as the project expands.

##  Vision

Modern systems often outgrow their original database choices. Data-Bridge aims to act as a reliable connector between NoSQL flexibility and SQL structure, making migrations smoother and more predictable.
